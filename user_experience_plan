-- Step 1 - Establishing show information (this happens initial use only, then info is stored)

User will be prompted to enter their show's information. Questions to include:
- Artist
- Album
- Year 
- Comment 
- URL

* - Suggest user leaves year blank to set tagging info to write current 
  year.
** - Suggest they include the URL of their website int the comment to 
  make the content evergreen across shows

Action - Upon completion, the computer will print "Thank you, You can now start tagging."


-- Step 2 - Drag and Drop your .mp3 into this Window Screen

User is prompted to drag and drop their .mp3 into the window. Computer remembers
path and moves onto next screen upon verification that file is .mp3
  NOTE: If not an .mp3, just have the text wiggle a bit and do nothing

(Screenshots included)

-- Step 3 - Thank You. Episode Title?

The episode title is the only dynamic piece of information required from the user
requiring input (.mp3 aside).

I've added two screenshots here to explain the user experience as the title of the
podcast exceeds the first line of the window.

-- Step 4 - Thank You. Your Podcast has Been Tagged in Excellence.

This screen reads once the .mp3 is tagged (this should be instantaneous after the 
user clicks enter)


Establishing First Version:

Of course, this is an initial tool which only provides for a single show. There
is lots of room to improve, but the hardest problems are in executing this tool.
Once we get this, it'll be much easier going forward.
